# SnakeGame
Presenting a Snake Game which is based on JAVA language and it's library 'swing.awt'.In this Game we have a panel in which snake is moving and eating food which is spawn randomly, to increase length.
We use arrow keys to control the snake and as much as snake eats food its length and score increases. Game will be over when it touches itself and to the boundary of the panel.
